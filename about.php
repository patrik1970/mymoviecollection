	<h2>About My Moviecollection</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>My Moviecolletion is a site for collection information about all the movies that I have seen during all this years.
	I have a idea to share information about movies and especially movies that I have seen. 
	I also rate all the movies to show what type of movies that I like best.  
			
	<p>It's also a site to show what I have learn during my 3 years at Malmö University as a programmer.
	I made this site during a webbprogrammer course at Malmö University in the autumn 2013.</p>
